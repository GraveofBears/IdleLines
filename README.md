# IdleLines

IdleLines is a lightweight World of Warcraft addon that displays atmospheric, poetic lines inside a beautifully styled tome‑like frame. Each line fades in one by one, creating a calm, immersive storytelling effect while you’re idle, waiting, or simply in the mood for something ambient.

The addon is fully customizable themes, fonts, scaling, fade timing, and more.
